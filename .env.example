# Map the public uploads folder in docker-compose (host path -> container /app/public/uploads)
# DEPRECATED comment above. We now serve uploads via a dynamic route and store files under /app/uploads.
# Example: on your host, set a persistent path where images should be stored
# PUBLIC_UPLOADS_PATH=../uploads

# Optional: override uploads base directory inside the app (defaults to process.cwd()/uploads => /app/uploads in Docker)
# UPLOADS_DIR=/app/uploads
